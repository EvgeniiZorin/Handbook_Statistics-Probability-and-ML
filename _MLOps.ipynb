Example: You’ve built a new system for making loan approval decisions. For now, its output is not used in any decision making process, and a human loan officer is solely responsible for deciding what loans to approve. But the system’s output is logged for analysis.\n",

So you start by rolling out the new model to, let's say, 5% of the users. Then, you can gradually ramp up that number. \n",
