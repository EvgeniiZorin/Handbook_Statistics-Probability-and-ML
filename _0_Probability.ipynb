    "Probability theory describes what properties our sample should have, given the properties of the underlying population. It is a purely theoretical discipline, telling us how likely an event is to happen and does not require data. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two related terms:\n",
    "- **Probability** is the proportion of times an event would occur in infinite repetitions; quantifying predictions of events yet to happen (the future); \n",
    "- **Likelihood** is measuring the frequency of events that already occurred (the past);\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relative frequency / empirical probability / experimental probability - probability based on past experience, in a number of non-infinite events; empirical probability estimates probabilities from experience and observation.\n",
    "  - Relative frequency: $\\frac{3}{9}, \\frac{6}{9}$\n",
    "  - Empirical probability: $0.333, 0.666$\n",
    "- Probability (classic definition) - limit of relative frequency as the number of events approaches infinity; probability for infinite number of events;\n",

    "| Term | Definition | Example |\n",

    "| **Trial** (experiment) | An event whose outcome is unknown. | |\n",
    "| **Event (E)** | An outcome of a trial.| An event that the sum of the two die is 11, $E = \\{(5,6), (6,5)\\}$ |\n",
    "| **Sample space** (S, set) | A set of all possible outcomes of a trial. | For a roll of a six-sided die, $S = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6 \\}$ |\n",

    "Probability of an event is the number of desirable events divided by the total number of events in the sample space:\n",
    "$$ P(E) = \\frac{n(E)}{n(S)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theoretical probability** is like what we expect to see in flipping a coin. E.g. probability of landing a coin on Heads is $P(H) = 0.5$; if we have a 6-sided die, the probability of landing a score that equals to 3 or more is $P(\\ge3) = 4/6 = 2/3$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experimental probability** is an estimate we make based on previous experience. E.g. if we played 16 games in the past, and we make a histogram with number of points and count for each bin, we can later make a prediction for the 17th game based on past data, for example, the probability of obtaining a score that is more than a certain number.\n",

    "In probability, **The Law of Large Numbers** states that experimental probability gets closer to the theoretical probability with a large number of experiments. \n",

    "Types of probabilities:\n",
    "- **Marginal probability**: probability of a single event $P(X)$\n",
